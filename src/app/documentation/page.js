- Measures ability to pay short-term obligations
- **Good**: > 2.0 | **Acceptable**: 1.5-2.0 | **Concern**: < 1.5
- Example: Ratio of 3.42 means you have UGX 3.42 in assets for every UGX 1.00 in liabilities

**Quick Ratio** (Liquid Assets ÷ Current Liabilities)
- Similar to Current Ratio but excludes inventory
- **Good**: > 1.5 | **Acceptable**: 1.0-1.5 | **Concern**: < 1.0
- Tests immediate liquidity without selling physical items

**Debt-to-Equity Ratio** (Total Liabilities ÷ Total Equity)
- Indicates financial leverage and risk exposure
- **Healthy**: < 0.5 | **Moderate**: 0.5-1.0 | **High Risk**: > 1.0
- Lower is better - means less dependence on borrowed funds

**Debt-to-Assets Ratio** (Total Liabilities ÷ Total Assets)
- Shows what percentage of assets are financed by debt
- **Good**: < 0.4 | **Acceptable**: 0.4-0.6 | **Concern**: > 0.6
- Lower percentage indicates stronger financial position

**Working Capital** (Current Assets - Current Liabilities)
- Available funds for day-to-day operations
- Should be positive and growing
- Target: At least 3-6 months of operating expenses

**Profit Margin** (Net Profit ÷ Total Revenue × 100)
- Profitability efficiency percentage
- **Excellent**: > 25% | **Good**: 18-25% | **Needs Improvement**: < 18%
- Shows how much profit you keep from each shilling earned`,

          content: `**Income Statement Insights:**

**What to Look For:**
🟢 **Green Indicators (↑)**: Positive growth - revenue increasing or expenses controlled
🔴 **Red Indicators (↓)**: Needs attention - revenue declining or expenses rising

**Key Metrics:**
1. **Profit Margin**: Should be 18-25% for healthy school operations
   - Above 25% = Excellent profitability
   - 18-25% = Healthy operations
   - Below 18% = Review expense structure

2. **Revenue Growth**: Year-over-year increase
   - Target: 10-15% annual growth
   - Consider enrollment trends, fee adjustments

3. **Expense Control**: Expenses should grow slower than revenue
   - If expenses grow faster, investigate specific categories
   - Major expense: Salaries (typically 55-65% of total)

4. **Actionable Insights Panel**: Always read this first!
   - System highlights critical trends automatically
   - Provides specific recommendations
   - Prioritized by impact level (high/medium/low)

**Balance Sheet Interpretation:**

**Financial Health Indicators:**
- **Current Ratio > 2.0**: Strong liquidity - can pay obligations easily
- **Debt-to-Equity < 0.5**: Low risk - minimal debt burden
- **Asset Growth**: Positive growth indicates investment in infrastructure
- **Equity Growth**: Shows profitability is being retained (good sign)

**Red Flags to Watch:**
⚠️ Current Ratio < 1.5: May struggle to pay short-term bills
⚠️ High Debt-to-Assets > 0.6: Heavy reliance on borrowed funds
⚠️ Negative Working Capital: Insufficient funds for operations
⚠️ Declining Equity: School losing money or distributing too much`,
